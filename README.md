<br>**Assignments**


1.   Case 1: Coronary Heart Disease


> This case study aims for objectives as following
- Learn to read data from external sources using pandas’ read_csv -function
- Use keras’ neural networks to make an expert system to support in diagnostic decision
making
- Learn to test model architectures (number of layers, number of units, activation functions), solver optimizers and training settings (epochs, batch sizes, validation splits) 
- Learn to use matplotlib’s visualization tools to make graphical presentations of the training and validation results
- Learn to document the results clearly and in easily readable format
- Learn to perform methods to improve accuracy of model. For example, optimizer, regularizeation function, drop out, etc
- Learn to perform features selection and its methods like Gini coefficient and correlation coefficient
- Learn to implement cross validation to model and validate its accuracy




2.   Case 2: Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis


> This case study aims for objectives as following
- Learn to use convolution neural networks to classify medical images
- Use keras’ neural networks to make an expert system to support in Diaberic Retinopathy analysis
